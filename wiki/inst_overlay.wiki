#summary HOWTO Install non7top overlay.
#labels gentoo,overlay

== Installation ==

To install this overlay you should first read this gentoo-wiki article [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds HOWTO Installing 3rd Party Ebuilds]

To get a copy of non7top overlay tree just execute
{{{
# svn checkout http://non7top.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/overlay non7top
}}}

== Updating ==

You can always simply update your local copy using <i>svn up</i> command. But for me I use paludis to update all of my overlays. It allows me to use one single command to update portage and overlays.
First you need to install paludis
{{{
emerge paludis -av
}}}
Then you need to run script which configures paludis based on portage config. All info can be found at paludis official page. Than you should just download [http://non7top.googlecode.com/files/non7top.conf paludis repo config] and put it at /etc/paludis/repositories. Now just run paludis --sync
